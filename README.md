# College Lab Codes Semester 4

This repository contains various Java programs that were created as part of my college lab exercises. Each program serves a different purpose, from basic GUI applications to simple object-oriented programming examples. Below is a brief description of each file.

## Files

### FLAG.java
A Java program that draws a flag using the AWT library. This program demonstrates the basics of drawing shapes and colors on a frame.

### LINE.java
This program illustrates how to draw lines using Java's AWT library. It creates a frame and draws multiple lines with specified coordinates.

### LOGIN.java
A simple login page created using AWT components like Frame, Label, TextField, and Button. It showcases the basics of creating a graphical user interface in Java.

### PACMAN.java
A Java program that draws a Pac-Man shape on a frame. This example demonstrates the use of arc drawing in the AWT library.

### TrafficLight.java
A simulation of a traffic light using the AWT library. This program changes colors (red, yellow, green) to represent the traffic light's states.

### TriangleFace.java
A Java program that draws two triangles facing each other. It uses the AWT library to draw lines and strings on a frame.

### border.java
A program that demonstrates the use of borders in Java Swing. It creates a frame with various components that have different types of borders.

### info.java
A simple Java class that holds information about a person (name, address, and phone number). It demonstrates the use of getters and setters for encapsulation.

### multipleObj.java
This program illustrates the creation and use of multiple objects in Java. It demonstrates how to manage and manipulate multiple instances of a class.

### myClassOne.java
A basic Java class example that showcases class definition, object creation, and method invocation. It serves as an introduction to object-oriented programming in Java.

### student.java
A Java class representing a student. It includes fields for student details and methods to manipulate these details. This program demonstrates encapsulation and basic class operations.

### testStatic.java
This program illustrates the use of static variables and methods in Java. It shows how static members are shared across all instances of a class.
